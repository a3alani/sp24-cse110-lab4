1. What was the bug?
> The types of num1 and num2 are both strings so they got as strings instead of ints. For example "3" + "2" = "32" instead of 5

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.

> I would parse the num to int instead of string this way it get treated as int addition instead of string concatination. Screenshot added :)
